    title: "Maze Solver",
    description: "In 2019 I had an opportunity to work on building a Maze Solver Robot from scratch and program it  with my teammates. The objective of the project was to design a Maze Solver Robot that senses a black line and obstacles .When it senses obstacles it should stop 10cm away from it. Infra-red LEDs and photo-diodes were used to make the sensors. Coding the H-bridge and the STM Microcontroller was an amazing experience. I learnt how to work in a team and our robot was one of the best that was made in our class. On the left you will find  pictures showing the  line sensing robot we made.",

    title: "Lego Maze Solver",
    description:
      "In my first year I had an opportunity of working with a group of CPUT Electrical engineers. I was working on  their project of programming a LEGO maze solver robot. The robot was supposed to navigate through a treacherous building with obstacles, uneven floors and restricted areas to identify victims. When it identifies victims it is supposed to  leave rescue packages to aid anyone still trapped in a house when an accident has occurred. Time and technical skills were essential in carrying out its purpose. At first we had to program the robot to search through a maze. You can find a video on the left showing the robot following a maze. This was a very exciting experience and I learnt a lot from this project.",
